Whenever we wanted to get started with something, we should know what it is. So,...

# What is JAVA?

JAVA is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.

Ok, now I am here..don't fear!

### What is a high-level programming language?

High-level programming languages are user-friendly programming languages which means that they are easy to read and write. So, yep...don't worry, it's gonna be easy.

### What is Object-oriented programming language?

Objects have state and behavior which is nothing but they contain some data and some instructions for that data manipulation. You'll understand this slowly, once you get started with coding using classes and objects. Objects are nothing but an instance of a class. So, No worries...

### What is Platform-Independency?

Platform independency is nothing but an ability to run code on different operating systems. This can be achieved by byte code(byte code is an intermediate code after compilation which made java powerful).

The second thing which should bother us is why are we learning this.

So now...

# Why JAVA?

Even though there are programming languages like C, Python. Why should we learn java?

I found java interesting. Well, I found it interesting but that's not the answer!

### Java is secure and what makes java secure?

* Java has a bytecode verifier which checks if there is any malicious code in the bytecode.
    
* Unlike C, Java doesn't have any pointers which give direct access to memory.
    
* Java has type safety, Java is a strongly typed language(the type of variables cannot be changed at the run time). So, attackers cannot manipulate the type of data. Python which is dynamically typed.
    

### What makes the java platform independent?

* Byte code makes the java platform independent.Java follows WORA(write once run anywhere) principle. The source code upon compilation gives byte code and this byte code can run on any operating system which results in the same output. But whereas C and Python have some platform-specific libraries. So, for these programming languages, there is a need for modification to run on a different platform.
    

There are many other features as well...But these two are one of those features which made java powerful.

So,this is all you need to know before starting with java.Hope this helped you and all the best for your journey with java.Hope you reach the destination and succeed.
