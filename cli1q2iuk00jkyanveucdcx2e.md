Are you ready? ðŸš€

I'm the social media generation, and I'm not afraid to embrace it. I use social media to learn, to connect, and to have fun. So, this is how I encountered "ChatGPT" on my Instagram.

As we are all excited to try new things. I immediately rushed into it and asked "Who are you?" and "What do you do?". Then I started asking every stupid question that came to my mind and obviously got amazed by its answers. I found it really helpful. Then secondly "Bard" has come into the picture.

Bard is trained on data to date but chatGPT is not so.

I am glad they have come. Because they get the exact point onto the table

## How I used it?

### Used to prepare for exams:

I guess that is how most students use it. I used to ask a topic and also used to ask a long question to keep it simple, understandable and funny in a way I can remember the concept. This was very helpful.

### Explore concepts:

So, if something is not simple to understand when I heard from someone. I just used to go on chat with AI and asked to keep it easy.

And they have become my go-to tools every day.

For example, If you do not know how to debug the code on some editor, you can learn with just one click away.

Fun fact: I used to ask for a customized poem or song for my friend's birthdays and make use of other AI tools which would sing it out. That was fun.

## But!

When it comes to questions regarding coding. It used to mess up. So, do not believe in the codes given by them. Simple codes or questions are okay. But for something which is confusing, It also gets confused.

Currently, I prefer not you use them to learn to code. At times they give false answers as well, you just need to figure them out! So, that's a double work.

But I hope and believe that they will be working super great in the future. Because they are still experiments yet doing great.

This is my personal opinion of my experiments.

I absolutely loved them and I strongly feel people who embrace these tools can be great in terms of efficiency and many other aspects as well.

Thank you, let's meet again.
