Are you ready? ðŸš€

I'm the social media generation and am not afraid to embrace it. I use social media to learn, to connect, and to have fun. So, this is how I encountered "ChatGPT" on my Instagram.

As we are all excited to try new things. I immediately rushed into it and asked "Who are you?" and "What do you do?". Then I started asking every stupid question that came to my mind and got amazed by its answers. I found it helpful. Then secondly "Bard" has come into the picture.

Bard is trained on data to date but chatGPT is not so.

I am glad they have come. Because they get the exact point onto the table

## How I used it?

### Used to prepare for exams:

I guess that is how most students use it. I used to ask a topic and also used to ask a long question to keep it simple, understandable and funny in a way I can remember the concept. This was very helpful.

### Explore concepts:

So, if something is not simple to understand when I heard from someone. I just used to go on chat with AI and asked to keep it easy.

And they have become my go-to tools every day.

For example, If you do not know how to debug the code on some editor, you can learn it with just one click away.

Fun fact: I used to ask for a customized poem or song for my friend's birthdays and make use of other AI tools which would sing it out. That was fun.

# How I used it in my project?ðŸ¤”

Well, I have been developing a full-stack project. I'll share it with you soon. So, wait with excitement! Will reveal it.

So, basically, I am developing a project using React JS as the front end. So, I wanted to mainly focus on my development and so I have some components and need to get them styled. So, I have put my code onto Chat GPT and asked it to style by giving some suggestions with a clear and precise query. It has given a really good styled elements and I have done some modifications because I know CSS. It helped me in that way.

But the thing is you need to be careful, you shouldn't be asking and getting something you are not aware of. I follow that when I learn things, I learn them properly and ask for tips on how to learn them. But once you are done with the learning and did something on your own. It is good to save time while building your projects using AI tools like Chat GPT.

So, Coming to me getting the CSS part done for my elements helped me save time. So, that I can concentrate more on my other development part.

## But!

Simple codes or questions are okay. But for something confusing, It also gets confused. I think it also depends on your query. Your query should not be confusing.

At times they give false answers as well, you just need to figure them out! So, that's a double work.

But I hope and believe that they will be working super great in the future. Because they are still experiments yet doing great.

This is my personal opinion of my experiments.

I loved them and I strongly feel people who embrace these tools can be great in terms of efficiency and many other aspects as well.

Thank you, let's meet again.
